I find it hard\nTo drive your stupid car\nI find it hard\n'Cause I never get that far
Too scared too talk, too scared to try\nToo scared to know the reasons why
So what, pop is dead, it's no great loss\nSo many face lifts, it's face flew off
What do you want from me?\nNow you got me\nNow my energy you suck from me\nAnd I'm holding on for dear life
I can see me drowning\nCaught in the fire
You are the sun and moon and stars are you\nAnd I could never run away from you
You try at working out chaotic things\nAnd why should I believe myself, not you?
It's like the world is gonna end so soon\nAnd why should I believe myself?
Easy tumble, easy fall\nEasy rumble, easy doll\nI get up on easy love\nI get up on easy questions
Everything's burning down\nWe gotta put it out somehow
And if it's alright, I'll tell you, 'cause you never understand\nAnd if it's alright, I'll beg you, 'cause I'm a begging kind of man
And I resent you calling\nI resent your voice\nI resent that I\nDon't have a choice
I'm going out for a little drive\nAnd it could be the last time you see me alive
You, me and everything\nCaught in the fire
When you were here before\nCouldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel\nYour skin makes me cry
You float like a feather\nIn a beautiful world
I wish I was special\nYou're so fuckin' special
But I'm a creep\nI'm a weirdo\nWhat the hell am I doing here?\nI don't belong here
I don't care if it hurts\nI wanna have control\nI want a perfect body\nI want a perfect soul
I want you to notice\nWhen I'm not around
She's running out the door\nShe's running out
He's bitter and twisted\nHe knows what he wants
He wants to be loved and\nHe wants to belong\nHe wants us to listen\nHe wants us to weep
But how do you?\nHow do you?
And the wise man said I don't want to hear your voice\nAnd the thin man said I don't want to hear your voice
And they're cursing me, and they won't let me be\nAnd there's nothing to say, and there's nothing to do
Stop whispering, start shouting
And the feeling is that there's something wrong\n'Cause I can't find the words and I can't find the songs
Dear Sir, I have a complaint\nCan't remember what it is\nIt doesn't matter anyway
Been thinking about you\nYour records are here\nYour eyes are on my wall\nYour teeth are over there
But I'm still no one\nAnd you're my star\nWhat do you care?
I've been thinking about you\nSo how can you sleep?
And why should you care, when I'm not there?
All the things you've got\nThat you'll never need\nAll the things you've got\nI've bled and I bleed to please you
Destiny, destiny, protect me from the world\nDestiny, hold my hand, protect me from the world
Here we are, with our running and confusion\nAnd I don't see no confusion anywhere
Anyone can play guitar and they won't be a nothing anymore
Grow my hair\nGrow my hair, I am Jim Morrison\nGrow my hair\nI wanna be, wanna be, wanna be Jim Morrison
Soul destroyed with clever toys for little boys\nIt's inevitable, inevitable, it's a soul destroyed
We'll drop you anywhere\nWith no ripcord, no ripcord
Every time you're running out of here\nEvery time you're running I get the fear
I can't afford to breathe in this time
Please forget the words that I just blurted out\nIt wasn't me, it was my strange and creeping doubt
Even though I might, even though I try, I can't
So many things that keep, that keep me underground\nSo many words that I, that I can never find
I feel better\nI feel better now you've gone
And everything I touch\nTurns to stone
You can force it but it will not come\nYou can taste it but it will not form
Everything is broken\nEveryone is broken
Why can't you forget?
Where do we go from here?\nThe words are coming out all weird\nWhere are you now when I need you?
I need to wash myself again\nTo hide all the dirt and pain
Am I really sinking this low?
My baby's got the bends, oh no\nWe don't have any real friends
I wanna live, breathe\nI wanna be a part of the human race
You broke another mirror\nYou're turning into something you are not
Don't leave me high\nDon't leave me dry
Drying up in conversation\nYou will be the one who cannot talk
When you think you've got the world all sussed out\nThey're the ones who'll spit at you\nYou will be the one screaming out
It's the best thing that you've ever had\nThe best thing you've had has gone away
It wears her out\nIt wears her out
A green plastic watering can\nFor a fake Chinese rubber plant\nIn the fake plastic earth
She lives with a broken man\nA cracked polystyrene man\nWho just crumbles and burns
He used to do surgery\nFor girls in the eighties\nBut gravity always wins
She looks like the real thing\nShe tastes like the real thing\nMy fake plastic love
And if I could be who you wanted\nIf I could be who you wanted\nAll the time\nAll the time
Nice dream\n(If you think that you're strong enough)\nNice dream\n(If you think you belong enough)
You do it to yourself, you do\nAnd that's what really hurts
Don't get my sympathy\nHanging out the fifteenth floor
You've changed the locks three times\nHe still comes reeling through the door\nOne day I'll get to you\nAnd teach you how to get to purest hell
Faith, you're driving me away\nYou do it every day\nYou don't mean it, but it hurts like hell
My brain says I'm receiving pain\nA lack of oxygen\nFrom my life support, my iron lung
We're too young to fall asleep\nToo cynical to speak\nWe are losing it, can't you tell?
The headshrinkers, they want my everything\nMy uncle Bill, my Belisha beacon
And if you're frightened\nYou can be frightened\nYou can be, it's okay
Wish that I\nWas bulletproof
You have turned me into this\nJust wish that it was bulletproof
Blame it on the black star\nBlame it on the falling sky\nBlame it on the satellite\nThat beams me home
The troubled words of a troubled mind
I get on the train and I just stand about\nNow that I don't think of you\nI keep falling over, I keep passing out\nWhen I see a face like you
What am I coming to?\nI'm gonna melt down
Sometimes you sulk\nSometimes you burn
Rows of houses all bearing down on me\nI can feel their blue hands touching me
All these things into position\nAll these things we'll one day swallow whole
And fade out again
I can feel death, can see its beady eyes
Immerse your soul in love\nImmerse your soul in love
You want me?\nFuckin' well come and find me\nI'll be waiting\nWith a gun and a pack of sandwiches\nAnd nothing
You want me?\nFucking come on and break the door down\nI'm ready\nI'm ready
I want to\nI want to be someone else or I'll explode\nFloating upon the surface for the birds
Hey\nThis is only halfway
Save yourself the pain\nYou'll never get there
Grass is green at the edge of the bubble\nBeautiful gets into beautiful trouble
I tumble like a clown\nBefore your baying hounds\nI supplicate myself into your hands
A beautiful girl\nCan turn your world into dust
I never cared before
The easiest way to sleep at night is to carry on believing that I don't exist
How can you be sure? (I don't want you anymore)
Shake hands\nGenocide\nMolasses
I won't be alone\nWhen you're running in me
I must get out once in a while\nEverything is starting to die
I am not going back\nI am not going back
I am gone\nEverybody is raging\nAnd this fruits\nThey still taste of poison
I won't be around\nWhen you really need me
Why can't someone hold me?
I won't have the strenght\nWhen you really need me
In the next world war\nIn a jackknifed juggernaut\nI am born again
In the neon sign\nScrolling up and down\nI am born again
In an interstellar burst\nI'm back to save the universe
In a deep, deep sleep\nOf the innocent\nI am born again
I'm amazed that I survived\nAn airbag saved my life
Please, could you stop the noise\nI'm trying to get some rest\nFrom all the unborn chicken voices\nIn my head
What's that?\n(I may be paranoid, but not an android)
When I am king\nYou will be first against the wall\nWith your opinion\nWhich is of no consequence at all
Ambition makes you look pretty ugly\nKicking, squealing, Gucci little piggy
You don't remember, you don't remember\nWhy don't you remember my name?
Rain down, rain down\nCome on, rain down on me\nFrom a great height
That's it, sir, you're leaving\nThe crackle of pigskin\nThe dust and the screaming\nThe yuppies networking\nThe panic, the vomit (From a great height)\nThe panic, the vomit
God loves his children\nGod loves his children, yeah
I'm just uptight, uptight
I wish that they'd swoop down in a country lane\nLate at night when I'm driving\nTake me on board their beautiful ship\nShow me the world as I'd love to see it
I'd tell all my friends but they'd never believe me\nThey'd think that I'd finally lost it completely\nI'd show them the stars and the meaning of life\nThey'd shut me away
Wake from your sleep\nThe drying of your tears\nToday we escape, we escape
Sing us a song\nA song to keep us warm\nThere's such a chill\nSuch a chill
And you can laugh a spineless laugh\nWe hope your rules and wisdom choke you
We hope that you choke\nThat you choke
Disappointed people clinging on to bottles\nAnd when it comes it's so, so disappointing
Let down and hanging around\nCrushed like a bug in the ground
One day I am gonna grow wings\nA chemical reaction\nHysterical and useless
And one day\nI am gonna grow wings
Let down again
Karma police, arrest this man\nHe talks in maths, he buzzes like a fridge\nHe's like a detuned radio
Karma police, arrest this girl\nHer Hitler hairdo is making me feel ill\nAnd we have crashed her party
This is what you'll get\nWhen you mess with us
Karma police, I've given all I can\nIt's not enough, I've given all I can\nBut we're still on the payroll
For a minute there\nI lost myself, I lost myself
Fitter, healthier and more productive\nA pig\nIn a cage\nOn antibiotics
When I go forwards\nYou go backwards\nAnd somewhere we will meet
Say the right things when electioneering\nI trust I can rely on your vote
I am the key to the lock in your house\nThat keeps your toys in the basement
Do not cry out or hit the alarm
And either way you turn\nI'll be there\nOpen up your skull\nI'll be there\nClimbing up the walls
I've got the smell of a local man\nWho's got the loneliest feeling
Bring down the government\nThey don't, they don't speak for us
A heart that's full up like a landfill\nA job that slowly kills you\nBruises that won't heal
No alarms and no surprises\n(Get me out of here)
We are standing on the edge
It's gonna be a glorious day\nI feel my luck could change
Hey man, slow down
Idiot, slow down
Tears of joy now scare ourselves from all that you want to be
Plastic bag, middle class\nPolyethylene\nDecaffeinate, unleaded\nKeep all surfaces clean
If I get old, I will not give in\nBut if I do, remind me of this\nRemind me that once I was free\nOnce I was cool, once I was me
In a city of the future\nIt is difficult to concentrate\nMeet the boss, meet the wife\nEverybody's happy, everyone is made for life
But I'm okay, how are you?\nThanks for asking, thanks for asking
I'm okay, how are you?\nI hope you're okay too
She runs from the third world, pearly
Death to all who stand in your way\nWake, my dear
Distracted by irrelevance\nThe stress and the tension\nCrawling through the keyhole\nI'm in a lull
I was stronger\nI was better
Let it fall
I won't run away no more\nI promise even when I get bored\nI promise even when you lock me out\nI promise I say my prayers every night
Drift all you like from ocean to ocean\nSearch the whole world\nBut drunken confessions and hijacked affairs\nWill just make you more alone
You're my man of war
Yeah, the worms will come for you, big boots
This is the place\nSit down, you're safe now
You've been stuck in a lift\nWe've been trying to reach you
This is the place\nIt won't hurt ever again
Empty all your pockets\nBecause it's time to come home
You've been stuck in a lift\nIn the belly of a whale at the bottom of the ocean
Today is the first day\nOf the rest of your days
Everything in its right place
Yesterday I woke up sucking a lemon
There are two colours in my head\nWhat, what was that you tried to say?
I slip away\nI slipped on a little white lie
Standing in the shadows at the end of my bed
Everyone\nEveryone around here\nEveryone is so near\nIt's holding on
That there, that's not me
I walk through walls\nI float down the Liffey\nI'm not here\nThis isn't happening
I'm not here\nThis isn't happening
In a little while\nI'll be gone\nThe moment's already passed\nYeah, it's gone
Flies are buzzing 'round my head\nVultures circling the dead\nPicking up every last crumb
The big fish eat the little ones
You can try the best you can\nThe best you can is good enough
This one's optimistic\nThis one went to market\nThis one just came out of the swamp\nThis one drops a payload\nFodder for the animals\nLiving on an animal farm
I'd really like to help you, man
Nervous messed up marionette\nFloat around on a prison ship
Lundy, Fastnet, Irish Sea\nI got a message I can't read
I'm on your side\nNowhere to hide\nTrapdoors that open\nI spiral down
You're living in a fantasy world
I'm lost at sea\nDon't bother me\nI've lost my way\nI've lost my way
Who's in a bunker? Who's in a bunker?
I have seen too much\nI haven't seen enough, you haven't seen it
Here I'm allowed\nEverything all of the time
Ice Age coming, Ice Age coming
Let me hear both sides
We're not scaremongering\nThis is really happening, happening
Mobiles skwerking, mobiles chirping\nTake the money and run\nTake the money and run, take the money
Morning bell\nLight another candle and\nRelease me
Where'd you park the car?
Cut the kids in half
The lights are on but nobody's home\nNobody wants to be a slave
Red wine and sleeping pills\nHelp me get back to your arms
Cheap sex and sad films\nHelp me get where I belong
I think you're crazy, maybe
Stop sending letters\nLetters always get burned
It's not like the movies\nThey fed us on little white lies
I will see you in the next life
If you're in the forest, out of your mind\nHarpies in the branches, breaking your arms
If you're stuck in rainbows, shattering glass\nWhere you miss the moment, watching it pass
If you say the word, if you say the word
When you spend your life\nWishing on a twinkling star
When you forget how lucky you are\nBuried in rubble, sixty foot down
If you say the word\nThen I'll come running
When you change your friends like changing your clothes
After years of waiting nothing came\nAs your life flashed before your eyes, you realize
I'm a reasonable man\nGet off my case
After years of waiting nothing came\nAnd you realize you're looking in the wrong place
I jumped in the river and what did I see?\nBlack-eyed angels swam with me
There was nothing to fear and nothing to doubt
There are doors that lock and doors that don't\nThere are doors that let you in and out but never open\nAnd there are trapdoors that you can't come back from
Come on, come on\nYou think you drive me crazy?
You and whose army?
I might be wrong
I might be wrong, I might be wrong\nI could have sworn I saw a light coming on
I used to think\nThere was no future left at all
Let's go down the waterfall\nThink about the good times and never look back\nNever look back
What would I do?\nIf I did not have you?
I want you to know he's not coming back\nLook into my eyes, I'm not coming back
So knives out, cook him up\nSquash his head, put him in the pot
Look into my eyes\nIt's the only way you'll know I'm telling the truth
There are bad things to talk about\nBe constructive
Be a weapon we can use
Why don't you quiet down?
We're gonna crack your little souls\nCrack your little souls\nWe are the dollars and cents
You don't live in a business world and\nYou never go out and you never stay
We all have goals in a liberal world\nLiving in times when I can stand it, babe
While you make pretty speeches\nI'm being cut to shreds
And this just feels like\nSpinning plates
Once again, I'm in trouble with my only friend
She is putting on a smile\nLiving in a glasshouse
Don't talk politics and don't throw stones\nYour royal highnesses
Well of course I'd like to sit around and chat\nBut someone's listening in
I want to see you smile again
The amazing sound of the killing hordes\nThe day the banks collapse on us
Cease this endless chattering\nLike everything is fine\nWhen sorry is not good enough\nSit in the back while no-one drives
So glad, so glad you're mine
Don't fall asleep at the wheel
Please keep moving\nBetter keep moving
You don't really talk to me\nYou don't really say your words
Some things will never wash away
A little bit of knowledge will destroy you\nA little bit of knowledge will destroy you
Run until your lungs are sore\nUntil you cannot feel it anymore
I'll find another skin to wear
There's no use dwelling on\nOn what might have been\nJust think of all the fun\nYou could be having
We know the way you talk\nWe know what you want\nWe know what you want\nWhat you really want
Do you see light at the end of the tunnel?\n(These are things that get on my nerves)
Are you such a dreamer\nTo put the world to rights?
I'll stay home forever\nWhere two and two always makes a five
January has April showers\nAnd two and two always makes five
It's the devil's way now\nThere is no way out\nYou can scream and you can shout\nIt is too late now
You have not been\nPaying attention
All hail to the thief\nBut I'm not, but I'm not
Don't question my authority or put me in a box\nCause I'm not, cause I'm not
Sit down, stand up
Walk into the jaws of hell
We can wipe you out\nAnytime
The raindrops, the raindrops\nThe raindrops, the raindrops
I sailed the moon\nI spoke too soon\nAnd how much did it cost?
All evidence has been buried\nAll tapes have been erased
We tried but there was nothing we could do\nNothing we could do
We're backdrifters
Something big is gonna happen\nOver my dead body
I'm gonna go to sleep\nAnd let this wash all over me
We don't want the loonies taking over\nTiptoe 'round, tie him down
May pretty horses\nCome to you as you sleep
There's a gap in between\nThere's a gap where we meet\nWhere I end and you begin
Where I end and you begin
Where I end and where you start\nWhere you, you left me alone\nYou left me alone
I am up in the clouds\nAnd I can't, and I can't come down\nI can watch but not take part
I will eat you alive\nThere'll be no more lies
We want the sweet meats\nWe want the young blood
Murderers, you're murderers\nWe are not the same as you
When the walls bend, when the walls bend\nWith your breathing, with your breathing
They will suck you down to the other side
Your alarm bells\nThey should be ringing
In pitch dark\nI go walking in your landscape
Just 'cause you feel it\nDoesn't mean it's there
There's always a siren\nSinging you to shipwreck\n(Don't reach out, don't reach out)
Steer away from these rocks\nWe'd be a walking disaster
Why so green and lonely?
Heaven sent you to me\nTo me, to me
We are accidents waiting\nWaiting to happen
Meet the real world coming out of your shell
No no no no no no
I don't know why you bother\nNothing's ever good enough for you
You had to ruin it for all concerned\nIn a drunken punch-up at a wedding, yeah
The mongrel cat came home\nHolding half a head\nProceeded to show it off\nTo all his newfound friends
He said, I been where I liked\nI slept with who I like\nShe ate me up for breakfast\nShe screwed me in a vice
I don't know why I\nFeel so tongue-tied
Don't know why I\nFeel so skinned alive
My thoughts are misguided and a little naïve\nI twitch and I salivate like with myxomatosis
You should put me in a home or you should put me down\nI got myxomatosis, I got myxomatosis
Yeah, no one likes a smartass, but we all like stars
That wasn't my intention\nI did it for a reason
It must have got mixed up\nStrangled beaten up\nI got myxomatosis\nI got myxomatosis
Yesterday's headlines blown by the wind
Any fool can easy pick a hole, I only wish I could fall in
Somewhere I'm not\nScatterbrain
Dance, you fucker, dance, you fucker
Take it with the love it's given\nTake it with a pinch of salt\nTake it to the taxman
Don't look in the mirror\nAt the face you don't recognize
Help me, call the doctor, put me inside
I keep the wolf from the door but he calls me up\nCalls me on the phone\nTells me all the ways that he's gonna mess me up\nSteal all my children if I don't pay the ransom\nAnd I'll never see them again if I squeal to the cops
Oh, I wish you'd get up\nGet over, get up, get over, turn your tape off
Blow into this paperbag\nGo home, stop grinning at everyone
It was nice when it lasted but now it's gone
Blow into this paper bag
Oh somewhere over the rainbow, bluebirds fly\nAnd the dream that you dare to\nOh why, oh why can't I?
Mother Mary come for me\nFor I am a wicked child\nI have sinned and I am so confused\nFor I am a wicked child
I am the devil's son and I wish I could be good
If I could have kept on the straight and narrow and not have broke your heart
I know what you're thinking\nBut I'm not your property\nNo matter what you say\nNo matter what you say
Move along, there's nothing left to see\nJust a body, pouring down the street
How come I end up where I started?\nHow come I end up where I went wrong?\nWon't take my eyes off the ball again\nYou reel me out, then you cut the string
You used to be alright\nWhat happened?
Did the cat get your tongue?\nDid your string come undone?
One by one\nOne by one\nIt comes to us all\nIt's as soft as your pillow
Fifteen steps, then a sheer drop
I do not understand\nWhat it is I've done wrong\nFull of holes, check for pulse\nBlink your eyes\nOne for yes, two for no
I have no idea what I am talking about\nI'm trapped in this body and can't get out
Has the light gone out for you?\nBecause the light's gone out for me
They got a skin and they put me in
And for anyone else to see\nI'm a lie
Don't get any big ideas\nThey're not gonna happen
Now that you've found it, it's gone\nNow that you feel it, you don't
You paint yourself white\nAnd fill up with noise\nBut there'll be something missing
You've gone off the rails
You'll go to hell for what your dirty mind is thinking
In the deepest ocean\nThe bottom of the sea\nYour eyes\nThey turn me
Why should I stay here?\nWhy should I stay?
I'd be crazy not to follow\nFollow where you lead
Your eyes\nThey turn me
Turn me on to phantoms\nI follow to the edge\nOf the earth\nAnd fall off
Yeah, everybody leaves\nIf they get the chance
Yeah, everybody leaves\nIf they get the chance\nAnd this\nIs my chance
I get eaten by the worms\nAnd weird fishes
Picked over by the worms\nAnd weird fishes
Yeah, I...\nI'll hit the bottom\nHit the bottom and escape
I'm the next act\nWaiting in the wings
I'm an animal\nTrapped in your hot car
I am all the days\nThat you choose to ignore
You are all I need
You are all I need\nYou're all I need\nI'm in the middle of your picture\nLying in the reeds
I'm a moth\nWho just wants to share your light
I'm just an insect\nTrying to get out of the night
I only stick with you\nBecause there are no others
It's all wrong, it's all wrong, it's all wrong\nIt's all right, it's all right, it's all right
Wakey wakey\nRise and shine\nIt's on again, off again, on again
Watch me fall like dominoes in pretty patterns
Dead from the neck up\nI guess I'm stuffed, stuffed, stuffed
We thought you had it in you\nBut no, no, no\nFor no real reason
I love you but enough is enough, enough of that stuff
You've got a head full of feathers\nYou're gonna melt it to butter
Reckoner\nCan't take it with you\nDancing for your pleasure
You are not to blame for\nBittersweet distractors\nDare not speak its name
Because we separate\nLike ripples on a blank shore
I don't wanna be your friend\nI just wanna be your lover\nNo matter how it ends\nNo matter how it starts
Forget about your house of cards\nAnd I'll do mine
(Your ears should be burning)
Just as you take my hand\nJust as you write my number down\nJust as the drinks arrive\nJust as they play your favorite song
As your bad day disappears\nNo longer wound up like a spring
Before you had too much\nCome back in focus again
Before you run away from me\nBefore you're lost between the notes\nThe beat goes round and round
I never really got there\nI just pretended that I had
Words are blunt instruments\nWords are sawed-off shotguns
Jigsaw falling into place\nSo there is nothing to explain
You eye each other as you pass\nShe looks back, you look back\nNot just once\nNot just twice
You've got a light, you can feel it on your back
When I'm at the pearly gates\nThis will be on my videotape, my videotape
This is one for the good days\nAnd I have it all here\nIn red, blue, green\nRed, blue, green
You are my center when I spin away
This is my way of saying goodbye\nBecause I can't do it face to face\nI'm talking to you before it's too late
No matter what happens now\nYou shouldn't be afraid\nBecause I know today has been the most perfect day I've ever seen
I shall now amputate, I shall now contort
Get yourself together, let the light pour in\nPour yourself a hot bath, pour yourself a drink\nNothing's gonna happen without warning
Down is the new up
What if I just flip-flop?
You crawled off and left us, you crawled off and left us
Oh Maria, come slowly\nCome slowly to me\nI've been waiting\nPatient, patiently
I didn't care, but now I can see\nThat there's a way out
Appliances have gone berserk\nI cannot keep up
And I can't face the evening straight\nYou can offer me escape\nHouses move and houses speak\nIf you take me there you'll get relief
And if I'm gonna talk\nI just wanna talk\nPlease don't interrupt\nJust sit back and listen
It's too much, too bright, too powerful
Watch me dance, I'm a puppet\nYou can almost see the strings
I've been climbing up this ladder\nI've been wasting my time
Up on the ladder we're all tied to a stake\nUp on the ladder we wait for your mistake
Up on the ladder you're all the fucking same
If you are on the top, then it is a long drop\nIf you stare into the dark, the dark will stare back
I'm taking you down, I'm taking you down
This is just a nightmare\nSoon I'm going to wake up
Running from the bombers\nHiding in the forest\nRunning through the fields\nLaying flat on the ground\nJust like everybody
I don't wanna hear it\nI don't wanna know\nI just wanna run and hide\nThis is just a nightmare\nBut soon I'm gonna wake up\nSomeone's gonna bring me 'round
I'm taking you down, I'm taking you down\nI'm taking you down, when I go down
I want none of this\nThey're just bad memories
Take a lesson from me\nDon't get stuck on a dream
Open your mouth wide\nA universal sigh
And while the ocean blooms\nIt's what keeps me alive
So why does this still hurt?\nDon't blow your mind with whys
You know you should, but you don't
Good morning, Mr. Magpie\nHow are we today?\nNow you've stolen all my magic\nTook my melody
Don't turn nasty now\nThe dusts of hell\nThe pillar of my soul\nThe last one out of the box\nThe one who broke this spell
Once you've been hurt\nYou've been around enough
Obligations\nComplications\nRoutines and schedules\nThe drug that will kill you
Little by little, by hook or by crook\nNever in earnest, never get judged
I will shrink myself into your pocket\nInvisible\nDo what you want\nDo what you want
There's an empty space inside my heart\nWhere the weeds take root\nAnd now I'll set you free\nI'll set you free
Slowly we unfurl\nAs lotus flowers
'Cause all I want is the moon upon a stick\nJust to see what if\nJust to see what is
Listen to your heart
Sleight of hand\nJump off the end\nInto a clear lake\nNo one around
Don't hurt me, don't hurt me
Into your arms (Don't hurt me)
I think I should give up the ghost
It's like I've fallen out of bed\nFrom a long and vivid dream
Just exactly as I remember\nEvery word, every gesture\nI've my heart\nIn my mouth
I fell open, I lay under\nAt the tip off I lost your number\nI wanna slip over\nAnd get back under
And if you think this is over\nThen you're wrong
Wake me up, will you wake me up?
The Moonies are up on the mountain\nThe lunatics have taken over the asylum
You made a pig's ear\nYou made a rude mistake\nPaid off security\nAnd got through the gate\nYou got away with it\nBut we lie in wait
Where's the truth, what's the use\nIn hanging around, lost and found\nWith your head in the sand
Out of orbit\nAnd I always will
Beauty will destroy your mind\nSpare the gory details
Though I lived a lonely life\nI was confused\nA butcher\nI feel nothing
As it closes up my arms\nImposition of the worms\nUp, up, through my heart\nInto my brain
My heart's still pumping\nMy heart's still pumping
He's a worrier, worrier\nHere's a little bitch coming out of him
These are my twisted words\nWhen I feel you're still walking\nI know I should not look down\nBut I'm so sick of just talking
When are you coming back?\nI just can't stand it\nI just can't handle it
I just can't handle it
Give your leaders each a gun and then let them\nFight it out themselves
Stay in the shadows\nCheer at the gallows
This is a round-up\nThis is a low-flying panic attack
We know where you live
Red crosses on wooden doors\nIf you float, you burn
Burn the witch\nWe know where you live
Abandon all reason
Avoid all eye contact\nDo not react
Shoot the messengers
Dreamers\nThey never learn
Beyond the point\nOf no return\nThen it's too late\nThe damage is done
This goes\nBeyond me\nBeyond you
Then into your life, there comes a darkness\nThere's a spacecraft blocking out the sky\nAnd there's nowhere to hide\nYou run to the back and you cover your ears\nBut it's the loudest sound you've ever heard
We are helpless to resist\nInto our darkest hour
The grass grows over me
You've gotta be kidding me
Your face in the glass, in the glass\nIt was just a laugh, just a laugh\nIt's whatever you say it is\nIn split infinities
When you've had enough of me\nWhen you've had enough of me\nSweet darling\nSweet times
Now as I go upon my way\nSo let me go upon my way\nBorn of a light, born of a light
Switching on a light, one I didn't know\nTotally alive, totally released
Waking, waking up from shutdown\nFrom a thousand years of sleep\nYeah, you, you know what I mean
Different types of love\nAre possible
You really messed up everything\nYou really messed up everything
If you could take it all back again
Why should I be good if you're not?
This is a foul tasting medicine\nA foul tasting medicine\nTo be trapped in your full stop
Truth will mess you up, truth will mess you up
Will you take me back\nTake me back again
Hey, it's me, I just got off the train\nA frightening place, the faces are concrete grey\nAnd I'm wondering, should I turn around?\nBuy another ticket? The panic is coming on strong\nSo cold, from the inside out
So cold, from the inside out
I don't know where it leads\nAnd I don't really care
I feel this love to the core
A moon shaped pool\nDancing clothes won't let me in\nAnd now I know it's never gonna be, oh, me
But now I see you messing me around\nI don't want to know, I don't want to know
Broken hearts make it rain
It holds us like a phantom\nIt touches like a breeze
We are of the earth\nTo her we do return\nThe future is inside us\nIt's not somewhere else
We call upon the people\nThe people have this power\nThe numbers don't decide\nThe system is a lie
The numbers don't decide\nThe system is a lie
This dance, this dance\nIs like a weapon, is like a weapon\nOf self-defence, of self-defence\nAgainst the present, against the present\nThe present tense
Keep it light and keep it moving\nI am doing no harm
As my world comes crashing down\nI'll be dancing, freaking out\nDeaf, dumb, and blind
In you, I'm lost
Won't stop now, won't slack off\nOr all this love will be in vain
It's no one's business but mine\nWhere all this love has been in vain
All the holes at once are coming alive, set free\nOut of sight and out of mind, lonely\nAnd they pray
All the birds stay up in the trees\nAll the fish swim down to the deep\nThe lonely and their pray
I am here\nCome to me\nBefore it's too late
The one you light your fires to keep away\nIs crawling out upon its belly\nAnd all you have to do is say yes
I'll drown my beliefs\nTo have your babies\nI'll dress like your niece\nAnd wash your swollen feet
Just don't leave\nDon't leave
I'm not living\nI'm just killing time
Your tiny hands\nYour crazy kitten smile
And true love waits\nIn haunted attics\nAnd true love lives\nOn lollipops and crisps
Keep your distance\nThen no harm will come\nNo ill wind\nWill blow
Sudden words\nMust never be spoken
Keep your cool\nDo not give into emotion
I'm lost, I'm a ghost\nDispossessed, taken host
Fear puts a spell on us
